}
\arguments{
\item{p0}{Target toxicity probability. Default is 0.4.}

\item{theta}{True value for the dose-toxicity curve. Default is 3.}

\item{theta_0}{Nominal value of the dose-toxicity curve parameter (initial guess). Default is 2.7.}

\item{N}{Total number of patients (including both stages). Default is 24.}

\item{n_initial}{Number of patients per dose in stage 1. Default is 3.}

\item{q_0}{Toxicity probability at first dose. Default is 0.02.}

\item{q_2}{Fraction of patients in stage 1. Default is 0.5.}

\item{q_1}{Target probability of observing at least one toxicity during stage 1. Default is 0.9.}

\item{fixed_optimal_dose}{Reference dose for optimal design estimation. Default is 0.2032.}

\item{show_plot}{Logical. If TRUE, plots the dose levels for patients in the trial. Default is FALSE.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 1234.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
  \item{n_toxicities}{Total number of toxicities observed.}
  \item{mtd_estimated}{Estimated Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). If no toxicity is observed in the first stage, the MTD is set to the largest dose level used.}
  \item{mle_theta}{Estimated value of the dose-toxicity parameter \eqn{\theta}. Set to \code{NA} if no toxicity is detected in stage 1.}
  \item{x}{Vector of dose levels administered.}
  \item{y}{Vector of toxicity outcomes (1 = toxic, 0 = non-toxic).}
}
}
\description{
Performs one simulation run of a two-stage CRM design for estimating the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in phase I trials.
}
\note{
If no toxicity is observed during the first stage of the trial (i.e., \code{sum(y) == 0}), the simulation is terminated.
A warning is issued, and the MTD is conservatively estimated as the highest dose level reached.
The value of \code{mle_theta} is set to \code{NA} in this case.
